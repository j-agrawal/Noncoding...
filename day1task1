Problem : why the dates in the calender of sep 1752 are missing.
Solution: The gregarion reformation is assumed to be held in 1752 on 3rd sept. Till then most countries accepted the reformation but there were few countries who didn't recognized this reformation.so the 11 days were eliminated from the calender which makes it unusual.
